# Word Embeddings App

This app lets you experiment with the 50d GloVe embeddings (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). The embeddings can be used to find synonyms, fill in analogies, or take on other NLP-related tasks with varying degrees of success.  
  
To run the app, clone the repo and run the following shell scripts.
```
git clone git@github.com:hdmamin/embeddings_app.git  
cd embeddings_app
./build.sh  
./run.sh  
```
Then open a web browser and go to localhost:5000.
